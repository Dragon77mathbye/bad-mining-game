it's a bad mining game

controls shown in-game

this was one of my old projects and I decided to remake it for some reason

# How to Play

Move into a block or click it to mine it

If it doesn't break your tool is too weak

You can craft new tools in the inventory by pressing E

Adjust the map size in the settings if it is stuttering
